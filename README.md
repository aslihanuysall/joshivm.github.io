I'm an engineer deeply fascinated by the capabilities of deep neural networks. I'm big fan of automation and I work on projects along the same line. I have grate passion for self driving cars and I'm following every news on it ever since Google started working on it. I'll post my major projects on this site. Feel free to contact me if you share similar interests.
